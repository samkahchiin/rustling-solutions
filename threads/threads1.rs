// The idea is the thread spawned on line 22 is completing jobs while the main thread is
// monitoring progress until 10 jobs are completed. Because of the difference between the
// spawned threads' sleep time, and the waiting threads sleep time, when you see 6 lines
// of "waiting..." and the program ends without timing out when running,
// you've got it :)
